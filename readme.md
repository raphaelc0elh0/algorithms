## Sorting

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

### Selection sort

Selection sort is another simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array: the sorted subarray and the unsorted subarray. Initially, the sorted subarray is empty and the unsorted subarray is the entire array. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the leftmost element, thereby expanding the sorted subarray by one element.

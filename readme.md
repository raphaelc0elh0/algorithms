# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my work and notes from the [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/share/101X5s3@dz13ZyyAszUVEOnbV764PzezFhBQbiuUPi1Dqn5kBumokGE5IMtkncTOsWYi7wp5Bw==/) course on Udemy.

## Overview

In this course, I learned about various algorithms and data structures that are commonly used in computer science. This includes topics such as sorting and searching algorithms, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

## Contents

The repository is organized by topic, with each topic having its own folder containing relevant code and notes.

### Algorithms

- Sorting: implementation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
- Searching: implementation of linear search and binary search.

### Data structures

- Linked Lists: implementation of singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
- (still under development, more to come)

## Setup

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
To run tests, make sure to run the following commands:
```
yarn install
yarn test:all
```
